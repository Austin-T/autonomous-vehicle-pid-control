# Autonomous Vehicle PID Control
This repository contains a ROS docker image that can be deployed on an autonomous vehicle known as a "duckiebot". The image has a program that enables a vehicle to follow lanes, tail other vehicles at a safe distance with variable speed, and perform collision avoidance. The vehicle achieves this using proportional–integral–derivative (PID) control.
